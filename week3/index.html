        <h1>Week 03 Note</h1>
        <p>To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.
            Calling without an object: this == undefined
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”</li>
                <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething()</li>
                <li>Methods can reference the object as this</li>
                <li>The value of this is defined at run-time</li>
                <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called</li>
                <li>A function can be copied between objects</li>
                <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Chapter 5: Object</h1>
        <p>You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation superman.name</p>
        <p>You can also access an object’s properties using bracket notation superman['name']
            superman["real" + " " + "name"]
            </p>
            If you try to access a property that doesn’t exist, undefined will be returned:

            <p>he in operator can be used to check whether an object has a particular property
            'city' in superman;
            << false</p>
            
            <p>lternatively, you could also check to see if the property or method doesn’t return undefined</p>
            
            <p>s mentioned earlier, objects can inherit properties from other objects, so all objects have a method called hasOwnProperty()</p>
            
            <p>f we wanted to add a new city property to our superman object, we would do it like so:
            superman.city = 'Metropolis';
            << 'Metropolis'</p>
            
           <p>ou can change the value of an object’s properties at any time using assignment
            superman['real name'] = 'Kal-El';
            << 'Kal-El'</p>
            
            <p>ny property can be removed from an object using the delete operator.</p>
            
            <p>he values in nested objects can be accessed by referencing each property name in order using either dot or bracket notation:</p>
            <p>jla.wonderWoman.realName
                << "Diana Prince"<br>
                jla['flash']['realName']
                << "Barry Allen"<br>
                jla.aquaman['realName']
                << "Arthur Curry"<br>
                <br>
                how this can be done using a function called greet()<br>
                <br>
                function greet({greeting,name,age}) {<br>
                    return `${greeting}! My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
                The keyword this refers to the object that it is within. It can be used inside methods to gain access to the object’s properties.<br>
                
                This object has a sides property and a roll() method.<br>
                random() and floor() methods of the Math object to return a number.<br>
                
                The Math.abs() method returns the absolute value of a number.<br>
                Math.abs(-4.6);<br>
                << 4.6<br>
                <br>
                The Math.ceil() method will round a numberupto the next integer, or remain the same if it is already an integer<br>
                The Math.floor() method will round a numberdownto the next integer, or remain the same if it is already an integer<br>
                The Math.round() method will round a number to thenearestinteger<br>
                 the Math.trunc() method that returns the integer-part of a number – that is<br>
                The Math.exp() method will raise a number to the power of Euler’s constant<br>
                The Math.pow() method will raise any number (the first argument) to the power of another number <br>
                The Math.sqrt() method returns the positive square root of a number<br>
                The Math.cbrt() method was introduced in ES6, which returns the cube root of numbers<br>
                The Math.hypot() method was also introduced in ES6.<br>
                The Math.log() method returns the natural logarithm of a number<br>
                
                The Math.max() method returns the maximum number from its arguments<br>
                And the Math.min() method unsurprisingly returns the minimum number from the given arguments<br>
                The Math.sin() returns the sine of an angle<br>
                The Math.cos() returns the cosine of an angle<br>
                The Math.tan() returns the tangent of an angle<br>
                The Math.asin() returns the arcsine of a number. The result is an angle<br>
                The Math.acos() returns the arccosine of a number<br>
                The Math.atan() returns the arctangent of a number.<br>
                The Math.random() method is used to create random numbers<br>
                
                The getDay() and getUTCDay() methods are used to find the day of the week that the date object falls on.<br>
                The getMonth() and getUTCMonth() methods can be used to find the month of the date object.<br>
                The getFullYear() and getUTCFullYear() methods return the year of the date object<br>
                </p>
                <h1>Chapter 6: The Document Object Model.
                    What is the DOM?</h1>
                    <p>The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.<br>
                        Below is a node tree diagram for the ul element with a class of roster :<br>
                        </p>
                    <img src="../week3/images/ch6.png" alt="ch6-img" class="ch6-img">
                    <h2>Legacy DOM Shortcut Methods</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Document.body returns the body element of a web page, as we saw in the previous example.</li>
                        <li>Document.images returns a node list of all the images contained in the document.</li>
                        <li>Document.links returns a node list of all the <a> elements and <area> elements that have an href attribute.</li>
                        <li>Document.anchors returns a node list of all the <a> elements that have a name attribute.</li>
                        <li>Document.forms returns a node list of all the forms in the document. This will be used when we cover forms in Chapter 8.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The getElementById() method does exactly what it says on the tin.<br>
                        getElementsByTagName() will return a live node list of all the elements with the tag name that is provided as an argument.<br>
                       
                       The getAttribute() method returns the value of the attribute provided as an argument<br>
                       className property that allows the class of an element to be set directly<br>
                       The classList property is a list of all the classes an element has.<br>
                       The add method can be used to add a class to an element without overwriting any classes <br>
                       The remove method will remove a specific class from an element<br>
                       
                       The document object has a createElement() method that takes a tag name as a parameter and returns that element<br>
                       A text node can be created using the document.createTextNode() method<br>
                       Every node object has an appendChild() method that will add another node (given as an argument) as a child node<br>
                       
                       CSS 
                       Every element node has a style property.<br>
                       display property. This can be used to make elements disappear and reappear on the page as needed<br>
                       </p>
                <h1>Chapter 7. Events</h1>
                <p>
                    The addEventListener() method is called on a node object, the node to which the event listener is being applied<br>
                    document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething);<br>
                    <br>
                    The addEventListener() method can also be called without a nod.<br>
                    The target property returns a reference to the node that fired the event.<br>
                </p>
                <h2>Using click and doubleclick On The Same Element</h2>
                <p>You should be very cautious of attaching both a click and doubleclick event to the same element. <br>
                    This is because it’s impossible to tell if a click is the first click of a doubleclick or just a single click. <br>
                    This means that a doubleclick event willalwayscause the click event to fire.<br>
                    <br>
                    Three events that occur when a user presses a key are: keydown , keypress and keyup<br>
                    1.	The keydown event occurs when a key is pressed and willcontinue to occurif the key is held down.<br>
                    2.	The keypress event occurs after a keydown event but before a keyup event. <br>
                        The keypress event only occurs for keys that produce character input (plus the 'Delete' key). <br>
                        This means that it’s the most reliable way to find out the character that was pressed on the keyboard.<br>
                    3.	The keyup event occurs when a key is released.<br>
                    </p>
                <h1>Modifier Keys</h1>
                <p>Pressing the modifier keys such asShift,Ctrl,Altandmeta(Cmdon Mac) will fire the keydown and keyup events, <br>
                    but not the keypress event as they don't produce any characters on the screen.<br>
                    <br>
                    . An event listener can be removed using the removeEventListener() method. <br>
                     preventDefault() is a method of the event object that can be used inside the callback function to stop the default behavior happening.<br>
